# List the things you added for points

1. Created a total of 11 knots. 
2. The major choices the player can make are what name they'd like to be called, and what direction (left, right, or straight) they want to take in the story. The choices the player makes will alter the outcome of their character's story. 
3. Loop = The "go back" button when the player makes a wrong decision. 
4. The player can pick up a map to add to their inventory. Their inventory will be acknowledged in the story. 
5. Visited passages won't be displayed, such as the "left" option not being displayed again after the player already went that direction and came back.
